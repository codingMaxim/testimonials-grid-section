                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
                company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition
                and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a
                line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
                the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
